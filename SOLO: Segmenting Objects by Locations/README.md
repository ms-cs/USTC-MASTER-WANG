<br>Abstract:
<br>We present a new, embarrassingly simple approach to in-stance segmentation in images. Compared to many other dense prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, it is the arbi-trary number of instances that have made instance segmentation much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each in-stance, mainstream approaches either follow the “detect-then-segment” strategy, as used by, e.g., Mask R-CNN, or predict embedding vectors first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introduc-ing the notion of “instance categories”, which assigns cate-gories to each pixel within an instance according to the in-stance’s location and size, thus nicely converting instance mask segmentation into a classification-solvable problem. Now in-stance segmentation is decomposed into two classification tasks. We demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmen-tation framework with strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming recent single-shot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.
