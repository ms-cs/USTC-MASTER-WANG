Abstract: 
We present Momentum Contrast (MoCo) for unsuper-vised visual representation learning. From a perspective on contrastive learning [27] as dictionary look-up, we build a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder. This enables building a large and consistent dic-tionary on-the-fly that facilitates contrastive unsupervised learning. MoCo provides competitive results under the common linear protocol on ImageNet classification. More importantly, the representations learned by MoCo transfer well to downstream tasks. MoCo can outperform its super-vised pre-training counterpart in 7 detection/segmentation tasks on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and other datasets, some-times surpassing it by large margins. This suggests that the gap between unsupervised and supervised representa-tion learning has been largely closed in many vision tasks.
