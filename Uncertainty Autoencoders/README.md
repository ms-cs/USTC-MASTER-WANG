Abstract : Compressed sensing techniques enable eﬃ-cient acquisition and recovery of sparse, high-dimensional data signals via low-<br>dimensional projections. In this work, we propose Un-certainty Autoencoders, a learning framework for unsupervised representation <br>learning in-spired by compressed sensing. We treat the low-dimensional projections as noisy latent representations of an autoencoder <br>and di-rectly learn both the acquisition (i.e., encod-ing) and amortized recovery (i.e., decoding) procedures. Our learning objective <br>optimizes for a tractable variational lower bound to the mutual information between the datapoints and the latent representations. We <br>show how our framework provides a uniﬁed treatment to several lines of research in dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, and <br>genera-tive modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate a 32% improvement on average over compet-ing approaches for the task of statistical <br>com-pressed sensing of high-dimensional datasets.
