Abstract : Compressed sensing techniques enable eﬃ-cient acquisition and recovery of sparse, high-dimensional data signals via low-dimensional projections. 
          In this work, we propose Un-certainty Autoencoders, a learning framework for unsupervised representation learning in-spired by compressed sensing. We treat 
          the low-dimensional projections as noisy latent representations of an autoencoder and di-rectly learn both the acquisition (i.e., encod-ing) and amortized 
          recovery (i.e., decoding) procedures. Our learning objective optimizes for a tractable variational lower bound to the mutual information between the datapoints 
          and the latent representations. We show how our framework provides a uniﬁed treatment to several lines of research in dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, 
          and genera-tive modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate a 32% improvement on average over compet-ing approaches for the task of statistical com-pressed sensing 
          of high-dimensional datasets.
