`Abstract`:
We propose a new building block, IdleBlock, which nat-urally prunes connections within the block. To fully utilize the IdleBlock we break the tradition of monotonic design in state-of-the-art networks, and introducing hybrid composi-tion with IdleBlock. We study hybrid composition on Mo-bileNet v3 [9] and EfficientNet-B0 [24], two of the most effi-cient networks. Without any neural architecture search, the deeper MobileNet v3 with hybrid composition design sur-passes possibly all state-of-the-art image recognition net-work designed by human experts or neural architecture search algorithms. Similarly, the hybridized EfficientNet-B0 networks are more efficient than previous state-of-the-art networks with similar computation budgets. These re-sults suggest a new simpler and more efficient direction for network design and neural architecture search.
